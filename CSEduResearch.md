# Independent Study: CS Education Research

### About
Graduate level independent Study for CS Education Research at Colorado School of Mines. Purpose of the course was to "provide a scaffolded experience utilizing educational research strategies (e.g., literature review) to understand foundational qualitative and quantitative CS education research methods. Address techniques and strategies for conducting and writing an
effective literature review as well as research-based educational practices".

_Required Text:_
Fincher, S. A., & Robins, A. V. (Eds.). (2019). The Cambridge handbook of computing
education research. Cambridge University Press.

### Course Deliverables
#### Systematic Literature Review

This integrativeliterature review explores whetherboot camps, self-taught CS education, or associate programs are a worthy replacement of traditional four-year college/university educationwith a focus on computer science and information systems. This is accomplished byanalyzing current research studies,identifying common theoretical or conceptual research frameworks, expressing current researchgaps,and detailingfuture research topics using15 peer-reviewed journalarticlessurrounding this topic.This literature review has been broken down into fourmain themes: the worth of a college traditional college education, skills/qualificationsto be successful, description of the workforce, and alternatives to an undergraduate program.

#### Teaching Module 

Proposal of an instructional module to teach undergraduate students, that have completed their freshman course load and whom intended to major or minor in computer science, low-level programming that would occur toward the end of a 16 week semester. By the end of this module, students should be able have a firm understanding of the following subjects:

- Be able to distinguish the differences between a “smart” point and a raw pointer; functionality of heap-allocated memory management.
- Identify methods and libraries used for resource management; understand the connection between object lifetime and garbage collection.
- Demonstrate the rules of managing the lifecycle of an object using special functions; Distinguish between “the rule of zero” by avoiding definitions of default operations or “the rule of three” by defining a destructor, copy constructor, and copy assignment constructor.
- Identify functions, libraries, and methods that C and C++ have for memory lifecycle; Categorize the variations of memory management of C and C++.
