# Can You Get a Job without an Undergraduate Computer Science Degree?


## Abstract

This integrative literature review explores whether boot camps, self-taught CS education,
or associate programs are a worthy replacement of traditional four-year college/university
education with a focus on computer science and information systems. This is accomplished by
analyzing current research studies, identifying common theoretical or conceptual research
frameworks, expressing current research gaps, and detailing future research topics using 15 
peer-reviewed journal articles surrounding this topic. This literature review has been broken down
into four main themes: the worth of a college traditional college education, skills/qualifications
to be successful, description of the workforce, and alternatives to an undergraduate program.

## Background

Higher education has traditionally been a steppingstone in the “American Dream”. For
most industries, a bachelor’s degree is the minimum requirement in a job requisite. In pursuit of
education, students will “borrows $30,030 to attain a bachelor’s degree” [17] to attend an
average public university to be competitive when applying for jobs. The time commitment for
students to finish can take longer than four years considering “41% of bachelor’s degree earners
graduate within four years” [16]. Considering the above factors, alternative programs have
become popular such as vocational education, trade schools, apprenticeships, self-paced free and
paid resources, community college programs, and job training programs. Substitutes to computer
science degrees such as coding bootcamps have become quite popular. Typically, a computer
science undergraduate student spends 4 years acquiring knowledge and awareness of computing
at all levels which includes exploring circuits and computer architecture, operating systems, and
programming languages. Student are pushed to understand the theoretical and mathematical
aspects of computing, including the interdependence of hardware and software. Coding
bootcamps on the other hand are “on average, 10-12 weeks in duration, and emphasize teaching
the programming skills that employers look for from new software developer hires (particularly
front-end programming) while also enabling their graduates to grasp the most essential aspects of
coding” [12].

## Summary

While investigating this research question, research terms such as “alternative to
college”, “hiring for computer science bachelor degrees”, “computer science bachelor degree”,
“computer science bachelor degrees versus certifications”, “computer science bachelor degrees
versus associate degrees”, “bachelor degrees versus associate degree”, “coding boot camps”, and
“hiring for computer science associate degree” was the focal point. With these terms, 15 peer-reviewed 
journal articles were found that match one of the four themes. I was able to use Google
Scholar and Arthur Lake Library – Colorado School of Mines research database to find peerreviewed articles. 
These themes establish a timeline through the start of an individual’s education
through their professional careers.

### Skills/Qualifications to be in IT or Software Engineering

A qualitative survey was developed to examine (1) the technologies organizations are
currently using and expected to use in the future and (2) the job skills/knowledge needed for
current/anticipated jobs for recent graduates (both undergraduate and graduate). It establishes the
importance of various technologies and skills to better prepare students for the workforce. This
helped universities prepare students with the appropriate set of skills to meet the increased
demand within the market. In alinement with past surveys, “Windows platform was rated as the
highest importance with 90% surveyed stating it will have the same or more importance moving
forward. This was followed by Linux/Unix (50%) with MacOS (45%)”[14]. Software
technologies such as Windows Networking were included, as well as hardware products like
Cisco Technologies. MS SQL was rated the highest database platform. Slightly over 50% of
respondents feel AWS and Azure importance will remain the same or be greater in the next two
years, while Google Cloud and Salesforce will be less important moving forward. The results
concerning development languages suggest educators should consider incorporating web
development and open-source programming into their curriculum based on the growing
importance of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript programming. For business analysts, the continued
education and knowledge of gathering requirements and understanding different development
methodologies is important. Also evident is the need for increased security emphasis in the
curriculum. Continued demand for software developers and business analysts remains high and
suggests that IS curriculum continue to incorporate courses in programming and analysis/design.
Basic business communication skills (e.g., oral and written) remains high in the list of talents
desired by supervisors and IS/IT recruiters. The knowledge base mentioned can be acquired in
several ways and the debate in this paper to consider which is the best approach.

It is best to establish a general understanding of the technical requirements for being an
IT (information technology) personnel. It is significant to understand how employers value
different forms of skill acquisition (academic degree, certification, and experience). In this
referenced quantitative research study, a sample of 33,863 businesses was surveyed on
requirements for an entry-level position. It targeted the head of the company's IT departments
and/or HR recruiting managers in charge of hiring IT personnel. When asked “most of the
respondents (53.22%) answered that their company does not require an academic degree for a
person to be hired for an entry-level IT job. The remaining (46.78%) stated that their company
does require some kind of academic degree – associate degree (19.3%), bachelor degree
(23.68%), or other (3.8%)” [10]. This led to a conclusion that hiring IT personnel see academic
degrees as low value. The value of certifications varies by opinion depending on the person you
ask. They are a quick way proving knowledge on a subject manner, but employers don’t expect
employees to pursue earning them. On the other hand, experience (at some level) is highly
valued. The majority prefer experience for entry level applicants to be hired over academic
degree and certifications, and then provide the opportunity to increase their formal education.
The “sweet spot” though is a combination of academic degree and experience, because academic
degrees can be used as substitute for experience. There is a disparate depending on the size of the
company and/or if public or private because “private and public technology companies tend to be
smaller and require academic degrees from entry level employees, but private non-technology
and government companies tend to be large and not require academic degrees” [10]. In 
conclusion, a student should be aware of the company they intend to work for as to proper assess
the IT requirements for an entry level position.

### Description of the Workforce

As the need for software engineers grow, a gap will continue to widen as less US citizens
enroll in computer science programs. India, on the other hand, are leading in IT knowledge and
job placement. In China, software engineering is the hottest profession in demand because of the
increase in salary and the high competition to land a full-time role. But with only “90 percent of
the top universities’ graduates are being hired” [1], there is still a gap between job and available
candidates. The Chinese Education Ministry built 35 software institutions to fix the labor market
demand. In Ireland, employed software engineers are on a downward trend causing the
employment talent cap to grow. The country depends on migration to meet market demands. IT
students have been increasing in South America, especially Brazil and Argentina. Lastly,
because of the dot-com fallout in 2001, there are fewer software engineering graduates in
Canada. In general, these trends mentioned that overall demand for software engineering will
continue to increase. This rapid growth of available jobs is the primary reason for the gap in
supply and demand. While it seems that the dot-com fallout had an impact and jobs are moving
overseas, the number of domestic job opportunities will out way the number of available
developers.

From another perspective, many STEM bachelor's degree holders who do not currently
go into work in a STEM field. By analyzing uses restricted level data from the Education
Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002), seems likely that there are significant lose in the STEM
pipeline after initial degree completion. Results suggest that “non-Asian minority students are
significantly more likely to leave the STEM professional domain either shortly after obtaining a
bachelor's degree or by age 30” [13]. Nearly 73% of the students in the sample expressed an
intent to remain in a STEM occupation at age 30, and approximately 58% of STEM graduates
reported being in a directly related occupation. There have been solutions proposed to increase
post-baccalaureate participation in STEM. Completing field experience is related to significantly
lower chances of experiencing mismatch. Specific policy strategies could be devised to help
transfer and minority students bridge gaps such as funding, internships, and other forms of field
experience. Undergraduate programs in STEM should emphasize engagement opportunities in
faculty research, study abroad programs, community projects, and mentoring. Degree attainment
is only part of the STEM talent development and retention puzzle.

Lastly, a detailed descriptive statistic, regression analysis done using 2009 and 2010
American Community Surveys (ACS) examines the wages of native and immigrant computer
and engineering workers. Intention was to assess the labor market performance in the United
States. For holders of computer degrees, immigrants are overrepresented in the highest-paid and
most common field, computer science. While among engineering degree holders, immigrants are
slightly overrepresented in electrical engineering. Immigrants have higher forms of education
and are highly productive compared to their native counterparts. A difference in language is not a
major factor because most “educated immigrants may arrive with better English skills than
immigrants generally, and technical skills are particularly likely to transcend languages and 
borders” []. The reason that there are more immigrants in computer science related jobs is
because “39.9% of natives in the sample have less than a bachelor’s degree, and only 13.8%
have more than a bachelor’s degree. By contrast, only 11.5% of immigrants in the computer
occupation sample have less than a bachelor’s degree, while 43.9% have more than a bachelor’s
degree, most of them master’s degrees” []. In general, they have considerably higher wages in
computer and engineering occupations. It is important to understand that there are computing and
engineering job opportunities for natives, but they are not as qualified as immigrant workers.
That knowledge gap is a problem that is trying to be solved by universities and companies alike.

### Worth of a traditional college education

The cost benefit analysis for completing an undergraduate degree has picked up traction
due to the rise of tuition and forgone earnings while in college. A 1995 study using a sample of
youths aged fourteen to twenty-one in 1979, “found that the return for the average person to a
year of community college was about 4-7 percent, compared with about 6-9 percent for a year of
four-year college” [6]. Many workers with a bachelor's degree end up in jobs that do not require
these credentials. Students are more likely to benefit from postsecondary education the more
informed they are about the expenses associated with college and the potential financial options.
Even knowing the association with college degree and high salaries, “the link between college
and higher earnings cannot, however, be interpreted as showing a causal effect of college
attainment on earnings” [6]. Students uninterested in or unable to complete a four-year college
degree nevertheless appear to benefit from completing a two-year degree. Besides from potential
salary, there are other benefits of high education such as a greater sense of accomplishment,
independence, creativity, and social interactions. Lastly, considering the “worth value” of a
college degree is dictated by the field of study/occupation, institution student selectivity, and
whether a student completes the program. Salaries appear to be more associate with some majors
and not all which leads to the summative results/values mentioned before.

Considering the rise in cost of education, students and taxpayers are concerned about the
return on investment and the amount of high earning jobs. In 2012, an independent organization
called “College Measures” explored five states (Arkansas, Colorado, Tennessee, Texas, and
Virginia) and the link between “postsecondary student--level data with wage data for those
graduates” [5]. Through this quantitative study, it was found that some short-term credentials are
worth as much as a traditional long-term one. There were several instances in this study when
average earnings for associate degrees were higher than bachelor’s degrees. In addition, the high
value given to the institution that students earned their degree from now holds less weight
because “field of study is more important than the place of study” [5]. Graduates with STEM
associate degrees accompanied with certificates can have high wages similar, or more than,
graduates with STEM bachelor’s degrees.

### Alternatives to an undergraduate program

In Florida around 2004, educators and professionals recognized a shortage of STEM
(Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) technical workers earning bachelors and
associate degrees to meet the state’s diverse engineering requirements. In response, legislators 
and interested parties developed a plan for graduating high school students learn skills need for
tech. focused careers by applying for the engineering technology degree program. This was an
associate of science degree program that was intended to “reflect engineering technology,
advanced manufacturing, and related technology sectors” [9]. This article relates the history,
strategies, practices, and processes in leading a complete reconstruction of engineering
technology education in Florida’s college system. The structure of this associate degree that is
offered after high school that would provide participates with the knowledge the needed to be
active in engineering, advanced technology, manufacturing, and others. This was a qualitative
study that focused on implementation and sustainability. In general, this shows that the
traditional collegiate program needs to be more adaptable and non-static to be viable system.

With student trying to find alternative ways to save money, more families are considering
starting with two years of community college and transitioning to a university/college. To help,
there has been research conducted that examines whether the changes in the institutional and
student quality resulting from the growth in community colleges has affected the attainment of a
bachelor’s degree. There are conclusions that say although community college has made higher
education more available, “the probability of completion across three different decades reveals
that declining student quality has outweighed the decline (if any) of the quality of postsecondary
institutions” [2]. Even with the increase in college enrollment, there is no correlation to an
increase in the likelihood more students will attain a bachelor’s degree. Students who attend 2-
year colleges may not complete 4-year degrees due to higher opportunity costs. Cost can be since
more time is needed to complete a 4-year degree for community college transitioning students.
Overall, students who attended a community college are 19–39% less likely to earn a bachelor’s
degree. Students who attend 2-year colleges are at a disadvantage primarily due to lower
individual quality rather than the lower quality of 2-year colleges.

Outside of the US, there a focus on vocational training and how to implementation them
in higher education. In the French educational system, students have the choice between
vocational and traditional bachelor's program. Until the 1970s, “the university’s vocational role
was to prepare students for the public service, teaching, research, medical professions, and law”
[4]. French universities’ policies have been strongly criticized because of the poor
communication with employers (for example, expressing skills needed to be a part of the
workforce). Now, portion of the vocational training is designed with employers to meet their
needs and standards. This reduces the qualification mismatch between graduates and employers.
Results clearly show that “vocational education graduates benefited from their training to find a
better position on the labor market, especially when we compare with general bachelor students
with the same characteristics” [4]. These results are based on empirical analysis of the labor
market outcomes of vocational course graduates, and it uses data from the ‘Generation 2001’
survey carried out by Cereq (translation: Qualifications Study and Research Center) in Marseille,
France. In spring 2004, Cereq questioned 15,000 young people who had left initial training in
2001 which is representative of the 750,000 young people leaving the education system for the
first time that year. Keep in mind, “students having specialized in science and technology are
more frequently enrolled in vocational bachelor degrees than in general bachelor degrees” [4]. At 
university level, vocational training has helped to reduce professional downgrading and increase
wages.

Code bootcamps are designed to distill skills from a four-year degree that are in the
greatest market demand. Then, infuse them with relevant methodologies and practices to bridge
gap between university and the real world. CS undergraduates usually study theoretical
methodologies ranging from utilization of hardware components to machine learning.
Bootcamps have never been a curricular focus of the ACM or IEEE guidelines efforts. There is
not an accreditation requirement for bootcamps, so there is a risk in choosing a program. The
bootcamp goal is to “produce an efficient, reliable, “construction” worker. Figure 1 shows the
ranking of “Best of 2017” bootcamps and the technologies they teach and provide training for.
While there is likely significantly more room to extend professional skill in the realm of software
construction, industry needs people who can “hammer nails” and “saw wood” rather
immediately, hence the bootcamp phenomenon” [18]. Currently, management and experienced
professionals prefer an undergraduate degree, but that may not last forever. For someone
switching careers and already has an undergraduate degree, bootcamps are a great transition tool.

Figure 1: Code Bootcamp Technology Courses [18]

There are formal and informal barriers that coding camp graduates are expected to face.
A qualitative research study interviewed twenty-six coding bootcamp students and analyzed the
interviews using the Communities of Practice framework. It was hypothesized that the barriers
faced in other computing education and career change would also be faced by bootcamp students 
as they went through bootcamps and sought jobs in the software industry. For bootcamp
graduates to gain their first entry level position, they felt like they needed initial software
industry work experience, online portfolios, diverse network, relevant education background, and
interview skills. There are informal boundaries that participants talked about: knowledge,
identity, and belonging. Several students were skeptical of the success rates their boot camps
advertised. Some personal obstacles included the time to transition to entry-level positions,
financial costs, finding support from family and friends, location of final employment,
motivation, and confidence. Students entering the industry through bootcamps faced great
personal costs and risks via “financial costs that were a personal obstacle for students trying to
enter the software industry. These costs came from bootcamp tuition and prolonged
unemployment” [8]. Informal boundaries within bootcamps were often like those in the software
industry. Formal boundaries in bootcamps included admissions, payment, co-location, and
bootcamp stages. A major personal obstacle for bootcamps is intensity of the courses and time
commitment. Coding bootcamp students interview to viewed entering the software industry as
their high-level goal. Bootcamps can be part of an alternate path into the software industry, and
they provided a second chance for those who missed computing education opportunities earlier,
particularly for women. To be successful, “coding bootcamps should address the difficulties
faced by their students and the industry takes on more of the risks and costs, then bootcamps
have the potential to expand the pipeline into the software industry with more diverse talent,
while personally benefiting many more students to come” [8].

There is a considerable knowledge gap in programming and “soft skills”, which recent
college/university graduates alone are unable to fill. Coding bootcamps are being researched as a
viable solution. A study with 50 students (22 with a coding bootcamp background and 28 from a
4-year college) in southeastern region of the U.S. was conducted with the support of the National
Science Foundation (NSF) Core Research and Development Grant. Through 1-on-1 interviews,
researchers learned bootcamps are focused on finding a job or obtaining a promotion. Bootcamp
students ranged in age from early 20s to mid-50s. University students were 22 years old on
average. While college degrees are typically needed for an entry level job, bootcamp hires were
favored due to their age and experience. Hands-on projects and peer collaboration were
emphasized. Bootcamp environments were fast paced which mimicked the workplace. Results
suggest that “bootcamp student perspectives meanwhile suggest that these programs are
explicitly engaging in practices, which promote the soft skills that employers are seeking from
new hires” [12]. They also provide more immediate emphasis on feedback, industry
collaboration, job acquisition, and practical, hands-on experience than four-year undergraduate
programs. On the other hand, “50% of the college and university students in this study indicated
that they were developing soft skills like teamwork, collaboration, leadership, and problem
solving through their respective CS programs and through their general education courses,
electives, and campus organizations; these undergraduates were not necessarily able to project
why or how they would utilize these skills in the workplace” [12].

A qualitative study conducted a series of national focus groups and individual interviews
with representatives from the software development industry. It examines what skill sets industry
representatives expect of their entry-level software developers, and to what degree coding boot 
camps and 4-year degree programs are meeting such needs. Through interviewing hiring
managers, they were able to determine the "soft" and "hard" skills that software developers need.
“Soft” skills were uniformly the most prevalent topic of discussion; 100% of industry
participants noted the importance of soft skills in hiring. Figure 2 shows the desired soft skills by
industry representative. Some indicated that hires with “alternative degrees, such as music,
physics, or education degrees were successful due to similar problem-solving traits as CS
(computer science) graduates” [11]. Software development companies prefer candidates with upto-date 
knowledge which can be gained in a bootcamp because academia can be behind. Often,
code camp hires also had a college degree, albeit not in CS. Coding boot camps reported to be
necessarily more responsive to current industry needs. Preference for college degrees do not
necessarily preference for a CS degree. Preference for candidates with a 4-year degree or higher;
others prefer boot camp hires since they were often older and had more experience. So far, “it
does not appear from these focus groups that code camps are a threat to four-year programs” [11]
because most boot camp hires also have an undergraduate degree. Code bootcamps are seen as a
complement to someone that already has an undergraduate degree and wishes to change careers.
It is not best suited to a candidate without employment/career experience that exposed them to
learn appropriate “soft skills”.
Figure 2: Breakdown of Soft Skills desired by Industry Representatives [11]


Before this study reference below, there was not a general framework to compare
personnel for roles in information systems of people who have earned certifications in the hiring
process. An inductive grounded approach was used in the development of this new framework,
because “existing theories focus on issues that are tangential to, but do not directly address, the
phenomenon” [3]. In general, certifications are used as a job requirement, as a screening tool 
toward a pool of applicants, and/or as a substitute for education or experience. Even though
hiring managers have freedom to decide on a candidate, there are complex restrictions such as
the overall labor market, characteristics of the company, familiarity with certifications, volume
of applicants, type of positions and others. There are four main factors that influence the hiring
process: neo-institutional theory, relative bargaining power of stakeholders, theory of planned
behavior, and validity approach to certification. Conclusively, the framework “provides a bridge
between the institutionalized context, particularistic and contextualized beliefs of hiring
personnel and theories of personnel decision making” [3]. IT certifications provide a growing
impact in managing IT personnel because certifications are becoming more common. Depending
on how compelling the applicant is and the requirements of the company, IT certifications can
match employment requirements.
Synthesis of Results
Considering the accreditation is not established for coding bootcamps, it is difficult to
argue they are a “guaranteed” replacement for a traditional four-year computer program. Boot
camps have their own challenges the create barriers for students. These can include time, cost,
and job placement amongst others. To help fill the knowledge and head-up count gaps in
technology industries, they are still a good avenue for transitioning professionals. Considering
hiring managers are open, or more inclined, to hire a professional with strong “soft skills” and
experience, pursuing a 10 to 12-week boot camp program will give that candidate higher
chances. It is also common for companies to sponsor boot camp sessions for current employees.
From the research, this approach is not best suited for younger adults that do not have any
college or professional experience. Experience can range from earning an associate degree to
several years working in a tech firm. Universities are aware that the rising cost of education is a
deterrent from students applying. To mitigate this, universities are supporting certifications and
associate programs focused on the needs of the tech industry. Vocational programs are beginning
to return in-order to speed up the “on-boarding” process. Through vocational programs,
certifications, and associate degrees, students spend more time studying the topics they intend for
their careers.
Gaps in Current Research
Currently, there is not a lot of peer-reviewed articles analyzing the outcomes of students,
the program attendance, cost-value analysis of coding boot camps, and/or instructor
qualifications. Surveys with a large participate population needs to be conducted to determine the
job placement and salaries of boot camp graduates. To compare them to traditional four-year
programs, participants should have similar background, common age range, and incoming
knowledge. The quality of the education acquired from boot camps is lacking. Right now,
students can view rankings and review of programs, but there is not a governing body to regulate
the quality of these programs. A study focused on instructor qualification for boot camp should
be conducted. Just because a professional has worked in that career field, doesn’t mean they can
teach fundamental topics effectively. In all, the need to be a standard in place to judge
undergraduate programs against other effective opportunities. 
Future Research Topics
As other methods of education are going, especially in the post-pandemic digital age,
there should be future work considered university/college enrollment implications if boot camps
acquire accreditation. A wider range of instructor and student feedback should be gathered to
ascertain learning environments, industry collaborations, and program effectiveness. Research is
lacking in what academic institutions are offering via curriculum and the inter-relationships with
employers. There should be a focus on the opportunities for experience learns, company
internships, and educational department/company relationships. In addition, gathering
information about pathways for high school graduates to enter the work force easier and quicker.
There should be considerations that the beginning two-year commitment maybe costing students
more than the benefits they are receiving. Exploring vocational and associate programs in the
United States would help answer that scenario. Lastly, future studies in the structural inequities
within bootcamps and the software industry and the downstream differences in long-term careers
between software developers with CS degrees and with bootcamp training.
