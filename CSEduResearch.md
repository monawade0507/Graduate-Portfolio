1. Systematic Literature Review

This integrativeliterature review explores whetherboot camps, self-taught CS education, or associate programs are a worthy replacement of traditional four-year college/university educationwith a focus on computer science and information systems. This is accomplished byanalyzing current research studies,identifying common theoretical or conceptual research frameworks, expressing current researchgaps,and detailingfuture research topics using15 peer-reviewed journalarticlessurrounding this topic.This literature review has been broken down into fourmain themes: the worth of a college traditional college education, skills/qualificationsto be successful, description of the workforce, and alternatives to an undergraduate program.
