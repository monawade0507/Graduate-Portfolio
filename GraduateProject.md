# Graduate Project

## About
Working with <a href="https://mehmet.belviranli.com/">Dr. Mehmet Belviranli </a>, assistant professor in the Computer Science Department of Colorado School of Mines. His research group focuses creating ecosystems to increase performance and utilization of heterogeneous systems. In particular, I worked on two main things:
- Research survey about technologies to build a framework using both object detection and object tracking
- Understand DRAGON implemented with CuDF and RMM framework design and building simple arithmetic application for testing performance and capacity

### Research Survey



### Simple Arithmetic Application
